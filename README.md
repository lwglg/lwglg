- I’m a software engineer with 15 years experience, starting in a R&D setting, constructing embedded systems for data acquisition equipment and precision electromechanical devices, then later migrating to web development;
- I studied Electrical Engineering for three years at [UFSC](https://en.ufsc.br/) (Federal University of Santa Catarina, Brazil), having then switched to Mathematics in 2016, at the same university, obtaining a bachelor’s degree in 2019;
- I’m currently working as a back-end engineer designing scalable cloud-based software, with an emphasis on Python, TypeScript and Java languages, with a particular interest in event-driven architectures, workflow engine designs and complexity analysis;
- Working part-time as a private Math teacher mostly for students of undergrad and high school levels.
- [Terry A. Davis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5CvDYFSxhU) was right.
- My sincere opinion on my years working as a software engineer [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YxfnsVZJ4dFelXzAidN29Z2_HmzjwQ4_/view?usp=sharing).
- My [article](https://medium.com/better-programming/determining-time-complexity-of-algorithms-experimentally-4f844a5080ec) on Medium, concerning a practical application of [asymptotic Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptotic_analysis).
