- I’m a software engineer with 15 years experience, starting in a R&D setting, constructing embedded systems for data acquisition equipment and precision electromechanical devices, then later migrating to web development;
- I studied Electrical Engineering for three years at UFSC, having then switched to Mathematics in 2016, obtaining a bachelor’s degree in 2019;
- I’m currently working as a back-end engineer designing scalable cloud-based software, with an emphasis on Java, Python and TypeScript languages, with a particular interest in event-driven architectures and workflow engine design;
- Working part-time as a private Math teacher mostly for students of undergrad and high school levels.
- [Terry A. Davis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5CvDYFSxhU) was right.
